    "## New Experimental Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### generating trials  \n",
    "-> each trial consists of multiple objects, and a final location for the pointing task\n",
    " - the trials are configured with the `config` variable\n",
    "   - there OBJECT_PER_TRIAL objects per trial + another location for the pointing task\n",
    "   - each trial is configured with;\n",
    "     - the distance between the objects as determined with a range, specific to trial configuration.what kind of experimental controls?  \n",
    "     - whether the trial includes crossing the boundary (same setting for all objects within)  \n",
    "       - [] validate that there actually is at least one crossing, if crossing is allowed\n",
    "     - border visibility for the trial, specified for the entire trial (not individual movements)\n",
    "       - [] add this in\n",
    " - we do not keep any distances discrete\n",
    "   - real world includes noise; for now we are assuming that these variables will be continuous. Therefore,\n",
    "   - [] we will want to verify that our distances have consistent means and variances.\n",
    " - [] validate that the pointing ground-truth is above a threshold (> 0.5m)\n",
    " \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### object display\n",
    "- participant moves from target to target, revealing the next one each time\n",
    " - the object is always visible. if it is on the other side & blocked by boundary, they will know because they won't be able to see it\n",
    "- objects are the same geometrical shapes of different colors\n",
    "  - make sure that the colors are color-friendly\n",
    "      - [] pick a good color scheme\n",
    "      - [] ask participants about color-blindness\n",
    "  - vary shape and color from a random pool\n",
    "    - this increases performance in recall, so that we can actually measure the distance bias\n",
    "    - [] create a pool of different shapes and colors\n",
    "    - [] pick randomly for each object\n",
    "      - [] between participants, look into keeping the seed same\n",
    "   \n",
    "- [] investigate potential interference effect from proximity:\n",
    "  - what's the average distance for the nth object?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### pointing task / data collection / data analysis\n",
    "- we want to control for the time and distance elapsed when moving, as well as the time taken for pointing\n",
    "  - time taken pointing as a potential proxy for confidence?  \n",
    " \n",
    "- we cue the participant for the object to recall\n",
    "  - pointing task already has the participant inputting data by moving a pseudo-object\n",
    "    - [] change this to the object that they actually saw \n",
    "  - we ask about the objects in a random permutation order\n",
    "    - we can investigate recency & primacy already, permutation order could enhance or diminish those effects, look into it during analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- [] make list of all variables we will be tracking during the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### implementation\n",
    "[ ] look into the unity implementation and think about how we can integrate these changes there\n",
    "    [ ] if possible, start revamping the experiment to follow this approach with some dummy testing trials  "
